          <p>
            Josephine Patrick Foundation is a Christian faith-based, non-governmental charity organization that began as
            a grassroots movement in response to the challenges faced by vulnerable groups—particularly Orphans and
            Vulnerable Children (OVCs), young women and girls, youth, Persons Living with Disabilities (PLWDs), and the
            elderly. <br>
            Founded to promote Community Social Inclusiveness in the communities of Northern Uganda, the foundation also
            operates as an income-generating (IGA) social enterprise to support local needs through God's mercy and
            divine guidance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since its inception, the foundation has grown from providing shelter to the elderly and supporting OVCs to
            delivering a wide range of services, including nutrition, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention, water,
            sanitation and hygiene (WASH), livelihood development, and the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. <br>
            Now recognized as a community-based organization, Josephine Patrick Foundation remains committed to its
            mission: <br>
            <span>
              “To provide a warm, caring, Christian environment with quality care, support, and a sense of
              security—focusing on the holistic wellness, dignity, and wellbeing of the community in everything we do.”
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Approximately 300 individuals from Key Populations (KPs), Vulnerable Populations (VPs), and Priority
            Populations (PPs) have benefitted from initiatives led by the Josephine Patrick Foundation within Lira
            District. This impact has been made possible in part due to consistent development support from Greater Love
            Financial Services and other dedicated development partners.
          </p>

          <p>
            Legally registered as a Community-Based Organization (CBO), Josephine Patrick Foundation has its
            headquarters in Lira City, Northern Uganda. Initially established in 2017 as an informal grassroots
            initiative, it was officially recognized as a CBO on April 12, 2024, by the Lira City Council under
            Registration No. 24/LCC/056L, in accordance with the Non-Governmental Organizations Act, 2016.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Foundation's main operational office remains based in Lira City. As Uganda's population continues to
            grow—predominantly in rural areas—access to education, healthcare, and spiritual guidance remains severely
            limited. Public health and education services are underfunded, forcing many Ugandans to seek private
            alternatives. In response, Josephine Patrick Foundation is addressing these gaps by delivering
            community-based education and medical services, particularly targeting the elderly, people with disabilities
            (PWDs), persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIVs), and Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs) in underserved
            rural regions.
          </p>

          <p>
            To further expand its outreach, the Foundation recently launched a community-based social organization as a
            “give-back” initiative to serve broader population needs through planned interventions.
          </p>

          <h3>Strategic Partnerships and Impact</h3>
          <p>Josephine Patrick Foundation collaborates with regional, national, and international partners to empower
            rural communities in the fight against poverty, disease, gender-based violence (GBV), and social
            injustice—including spiritual neglect. Its programs have positively impacted a wide range of populations
            including the elderly, women, girls, youth, PLHIVs, OVCs, KPs, PPs, and PWDs. <br>
            The Foundation's work is guided by global and national development frameworks, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Uganda Vision 2040</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>National Development Plan II (2019/20 - 2020/2024)</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Sector-specific strategic plans and policies</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>A Strategic Transition for Lasting Change</h3>
          <p>Three years into its formal establishment, the Foundation undertook a strategic planning process to reflect
            on its journey and prepare for the future. This marks a pivotal transition into a strategic development
            partner in areas such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Health</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Education and Literacy</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Livelihoods</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Human Rights</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>GBV prevention</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Social Justice</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All these are integrated with the spreading of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through church establishment and
            outreach ministries. <br>
            The strategic plan aims to sharpen the Foundation's focus, build programmatic expertise, and strengthen its
            ability to respond to the needs and aspirations of vulnerable communities across the Lango Sub-Region.
          </p>

          <h3>Planning for the Future</h3>
          <p>This forward-looking plan outlines the Foundation's:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Mandate</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Vision and Mission</li>

            <li><i class="bi bi-check2-circle"></i>Human and Institutional Development Priorities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Drawing from its extensive experience—ranging from COVID-19 response to post-conflict recovery
            efforts—Josephine Patrick Foundation has demonstrated its resilience, adaptability, and capacity to deliver
            sustainable, pro-poor solutions. <br>
            Its renewed mandate is clear: <br>
            <span>
              "To contribute to the realization of an Inspired, Compassionate, and Independent Society."

                    <p>JPF works to reinforce primary and secondary healthcare in vulnerable communities by offering affordable, quality health services, including:</p>
                    <div class="prog-list">

                    <h3>II. Better Health for Infants, Children, and Their Families</h3>
                    <p>Changing children's worlds begins with improving their health and that of their families. In Northern Uganda, basic healthcare remains out of reach for many children, and common illnesses such as malaria, diarrhoea, ulcers, and respiratory infections can quickly become life-threatening if left untreated.</p>
                    <div class="prog-list">
                      <p><i class="bi bi-check2-circle check-icon"></i>Malaria remains the leading cause of death in Uganda, claiming nearly 200 lives daily, with young children and pregnant women most affected.</p>
                      <p><i class="bi bi-check2-circle check-icon"></i>Shockingly, half of all malaria deaths occur in children under five years old.</p>

                    </div>
                    <P>
                      JPF not only seeks to treat malaria and other preventable diseases, but also to stop their spread through education, access to preventive tools like mosquito nets, and community awareness campaigns. <br>
                      Ensuring access to basic medical care is a key priority in our mission to enhance child survival and overall community health.
                    </P>

                    <h3>III. HIV/AIDS-Focused Healthcare & Awareness</h3>
                    <p>HIV/AIDS continues to be a major health crisis in Uganda, complicated by stigma, misinformation, and limited access to education.</p>
                    <p>JPF combats this by:</p>
                    <div class="prog-list">

                    </P>

                    <h3>IV. Nutrition Support for Children and Families</h3>
                    <p>At JPF, we believe that every child has the right to reach their full potential—and that starts with good nutrition.</p>
                    <p>Despite growing awareness, malnutrition still severely affects infants and children in Northern Uganda. To address this:</p>
                    <div class="prog-list">
                      <p><i class="bi bi-check2-circle check-icon"></i>We provide daily school meals to nursery and primary pupils—boosting attendance, focus, and academic success.</p>
                      <p><i class="bi bi-check2-circle check-icon"></i>Our school nutrition program also improves health outcomes, reduces dropout rates (especially among girls), and encourages families to prioritize education.</p>
                      <p><i class="bi bi-check2-circle check-icon"></i>We offer nutrition support at home for orphaned, malnourished infants, and elderly individuals, after assessing their unique needs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <P>
                      Given the average of five children per Ugandan woman, coupled with poverty, food insecurity, and land scarcity, our interventions are critical to community resilience.
                    </P>

                    <h3>Why the Health & Nutrition Program Matters</h3>
                    <p>Northern Uganda continues to face systemic barriers to health and nutrition—including poverty, gender inequality, unreliable food sources, and limited healthcare access.</p>
                    <p>With your support, Josephine Patrick Foundation will continue to provide lifesaving health services, nutritious meals, and preventative education, creating a brighter, healthier future for children and families alike.</p>
                    <p>Together, we can build communities where every child not only survives—but thrives.</p>

                      Access to clean water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices is fundamental to a healthy
                      life.
                      However, in Uganda, fewer than 57% of the population have access to even basic sanitation, and
                      nearly 90%
                      of child deaths from diarrhoeal diseases are directly linked to unsafe water, poor sanitation, or
                      inadequate hygiene. These challenges are further compounded by outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola
                      and
                      cholera.

                    <p>
                      Water and sanitation-related illnesses like diarrhoea and malaria remain among the top causes of
                      death in
                      children under five. Despite major investments in Uganda's water sector, many rural and urban
                      communities
                      still lack reliable access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>Education lies at the heart of the Josephine Patrick Foundation. Nearly eight years ago, our founder Benard began teaching songs, prayers, and the alphabet to young children under a mango tree at his mother's compound. With limited resources but a strong conviction, he used his motorbike taxi income to fund educational materials for vulnerable children. What began with a handful of learners has grown into a core program supporting over 500 children from Kindergarten 1 to Primary 7.</p>
                    <p>JPF's commitment to early education is deeply aligned with the Ugandan government's mission to raise national literacy levels. We believe that every child has the right to quality education, regardless of their background. Our goal is to ensure children in Northern Uganda have more opportunities than their parents had and are empowered to reach their full potential.</p>

                      Research shows that every additional year of primary school increases a girl's future income by 10-20%. Educated girls grow into women who uplift their families and transform communities. At JPF, we are laying that foundation.

                    <h3>II. Vocational Education and Training</h3>
                    <p>Empowering youth with practical skills that lead to employment or entrepreneurship is one of the most impactful ways we support young adults in our community. With high youth unemployment, rising teenage pregnancies, and substance abuse affecting many young people in northern Uganda, vocational training offers a way out—and a way forward.</p>
                    <p>JPF provides informal tailoring and garment-cutting training, giving both girls and boys hands-on experience and a chance to build their future. Many of our graduates have:</p>

                    <P>
                      One such example is Apio Sharon, who began practicing under a mango tree at our training site. Orphaned at six and raised by her elderly great-aunt, Sharon enrolled in our skills program with the dream of becoming a tailoring teacher. “Life is very hard,” she said. “I wanted to learn skills that I could use to earn an income.”

                    <P>
                      At JPF's Vocational Training Centre, over 70% of graduates find or create jobs, empowering not just themselves, but their entire households.

                      Every child has the right to a safe and nurturing childhood—free from violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. At Josephine Patrick Foundation (JPF), we work in close partnership with the Ugandan Government and local NGOs to uphold and advocate for children's rights within the communities we serve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While child protection is a cross-cutting theme in all our programs, we also run dedicated initiatives aimed specifically at safeguarding children. These include community sensitization on children's rights, parenting programs for caregivers of primary school children, and direct support for at-risk children. Our goal is to ensure every child's safety and well-being.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whenever possible, JPF works to reintegrate children with their biological or extended families. In more critical cases, we offer short- or long-term care depending on each child's situation. We believe that protecting children is a shared responsibility—whether by advocating for the voiceless, reporting abuse, or partnering with stakeholders implementing child protection initiatives.</p>

                  <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h3>I. Family Strengthening</h3>
                    <p>Grounded in the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, JPF believes that the family is the fundamental unit for a child's development. We work with vulnerable families to enhance their capacity to care for and protect their children, preventing family separation whenever possible.</p>

                    <h3>II. Alternative Care</h3>
                    <p>EFor children who cannot live with their families, JPF provides short-term care in safe, nurturing environments. Our alternative care models include:</p>

                    <h3>Support for Older Adults and People with Disabilities</h3>
                    <p>In addition to child-focused initiatives, JPF runs programs that promote the well-being of older adults and individuals living with disabilities. Our services support independent living in the community or institutional settings, including access to palliative care and other essential assistance.</p>

                      At the heart of JPF's outreach efforts is our Gospel and Worship Crusade—one of the most impactful Christian praise and worship ministries in Lira and across Northern Uganda. Through this initiative, we bring the message of Christ, hope, and life-changing education to thousands of people across the region.

                    <p>
                      In communities where access to television, internet, and newspapers remains limited, our radio program plays a vital role. It serves as the main source of spiritual nourishment and community education, broadcasting the Word of God daily to households far and wide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      By sharing the Gospel and practical messages of encouragement, our programs foster hope, strengthen families, and help rebuild communities facing ongoing social and economic challenges. Through music, preaching, and community-based engagement, JPF continues to serve as a beacon of light and faith in Northern Uganda.

            <h3>Mr. Odongo Benard</h3>
            <p>Founder / CEO</p>

            <h4>Biography</h4>
            <p>In 2018, a Christian movement started to come out with ideas to gather together in fellowship in Christ
              Jesus; there where Benard (one of the group's member) became concerned about the plight of the children in
              Northern Uganda, especially those abandoned and neglected children, and those living in the care of their
              destitute elderly grandmothers and/or disabled guardians. <br> Benard felt God's call on his life to help
              them realize their potentials even if little he can afford to gather for them (vulnerable children).</p>
            <p>Benard was born during insurgency and lived through 20 years of war, attacks, poverty and refugee camp
              life and spent a third of his life with his mother in Northern Uganda. He lost his father26 years ago and
              he surely understand the vulnerabilities of children living in foster homes and single parents</p>
            <p>Responsible for overseeing all facets of the organization, Benard drives the mission, fundraising,
              operations, and engagement with the board of directors. He has single-handedly turned the charity
              organization around by aligning the day-to-day work with values around diversity, equity, inclusion, and
              accessibility.</p>
            <p>Benard is a strong Christian leader within the sector, making him a dynamic advocate for the entire
              nonprofit ministry; and he has extensive experience as a locally grantmaker focused on believing in God's
              favors and the arts of thanksgivings.</p>
